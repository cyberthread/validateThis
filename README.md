# Exercise: Validate This
One way to practice your HTML skills is by fixing HTML that is not written correctly. In this exercise you will edit the code in the provided HTML file so that the tags used are the most semantic option for the content and so that the HTML is valid. For this assignment you will need the [W3C Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

The best way to tackle this assignment is to:
1. Read through the code and try to understand what the intent is
1. Fix any typos or organizational errors that you see (sometimes the code editor provides us with visual indicators of areas where something isn't quite right)
1. Look for any content that has an incorrect or non-semantic tag assigned
1. Run the code through the validation service. Address the first issue raised by the validator and then run the validator again. Sometimes one problem in the code can actually raise multiple validation issues.
1. Repeat steps above until there are no more validation errors or warnings and you are confident that the code is accurate.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code is valid
- Code is accurate and semantic

## Submission
Submit the following on Blackboard:
- Screenshot of validation service indicating you have no validation errors
- The URL to your repository (you don't need a live site, just the URL to this folder)
